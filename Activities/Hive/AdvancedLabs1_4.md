We've collected some more advanced labs in this section. To succeed completing these labs, you would have to read up on more of Hive than what we cover here.

Although you can simply run through the labs and learn what you can from it, it is important to know that we have not provided content for you to learn everything in the exercises in previous guides. However, if you found Hive so exciting that you think you will use it in the future, let us give you some suggested reading and some more advanced labs.
