# About the Labs

You should be able to follow these labs even if you don't have much programming experience.

The world count problem is classical in the Big Data space, because:

-   It is easy to understand
-   It illustrates how to do parallel processing
-   It requires some form of state merge from parallel processing steps

The problem we'll look at for many different technologies is, assuming we have a very large set of text (e.g., the every web-page in the world) and we want to count the number of times each word occurs in all the text, how do you do that using technology X.

For this class, technology X is going to be:

-   Java MapReduce jobs
-   Pig
-   Hive
